# TrustWipe Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Implementation Walkthrough

This guide provides a complete step-by-step process to build, test, and deploy the TrustWipe application.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Node.js version (must be 16+)
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version

# Check if you're in the correct directory
pwd
# Should show: /Users/chaitu0608/Desktop/trialtrial/sih2/super-wipe/super-wipe
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
npm install

# Expected output: Should install electron, drivelist, and electron-builder
```

### Step 3: Set Up File Permissions
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x wipe_linux.sh
chmod +x test-backend.js

# Create logs directory
mkdir -p logs
chmod 755 logs
```

## Phase 2: Testing and Validation

### Step 4: Run Backend Tests
```bash
# Execute the test suite
npm test

# Expected result: All 23 tests should pass
# âœ… All tests passed! Backend is ready.
```

### Step 5: Test Application Launch
```bash
# Start the application
npm start

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Electron window opens (1000x700 pixels)
# 2. Shows "TrustWipe" interface
# 3. Displays "Detected OS: [Your OS]"
# 4. Shows available drives in dropdown
# 5. No error messages in console
```

### Step 6: Verify Core Functionality
1. **OS Detection**: Should show your operating system
2. **Drive Detection**: Should list available drives (including fallback drives)
3. **UI Elements**: All buttons and dropdowns should be responsive
4. **Authentication**: Should accept `admin` / `password123`

## Phase 3: Configuration and Customization

### Step 7: Review Configuration
```bash
# Check current configuration
cat config.json

# Key settings to review:
# - Authentication credentials
# - Logging levels
# - Security settings
# - UI preferences
```

### Step 8: Customize Settings (Optional)
```bash
# Edit configuration file
nano config.json

# Recommended changes:
# 1. Change default username/password
# 2. Adjust logging level if needed
# 3. Modify UI window size if desired
```

### Step 9: Test Configuration Changes
```bash
# Restart application to apply changes
npm start

# Verify new settings are active
# Check logs/app.log for configuration loading
```

## Phase 4: Platform-Specific Setup

### Step 10: Linux Setup (if applicable)
```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hdparm nvme-cli pv

# Test wipe script manually (with test drive)
sudo ./wipe_linux.sh /dev/sdb sanitize admin password123
```

### Step 11: Windows Setup (if applicable)
```powershell
# Set PowerShell execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Test wipe script manually (with test drive)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File wipe_windows.ps1 -Drive "D:\" -Method "sanitize" -Username "admin" -Password "password123"
```

### Step 12: macOS Setup (if applicable)
```bash
# macOS has limited support
# Ensure proper permissions for drive access
# May need to run with sudo for drive operations
```

## Phase 5: Safety Testing

### Step 13: Create Test Environment
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use only non-critical drives for testing
# Recommended test drives:
# - USB flash drives
# - External hard drives
# - Secondary internal drives
# - Virtual drives

# NEVER test on:
# - System drives (C:, /, etc.)
# - Drives with important data
# - Boot drives
```

### Step 14: Test Wipe Operations
1. **Select Test Drive**: Choose a non-critical drive
2. **Choose Method**: Start with "sanitize" method
3. **Enter Credentials**: Use `admin` / `password123`
4. **Confirm Operation**: Click "Yes, Wipe Drive" in dialog
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch status messages
6. **Verify Completion**: Check logs for success message

### Step 15: Test Error Handling
```bash
# Test various error scenarios:
# 1. Invalid credentials
# 2. Non-existent drive
# 3. Insufficient permissions
# 4. Cancel operation mid-way
```

## Phase 6: Production Preparation

### Step 16: Security Hardening
```bash
# Change default credentials
nano config.json

# Set secure file permissions
chmod 600 config.json
chmod 600 wipe_linux.sh
chmod 600 wipe_windows.ps1

# Review and update authentication settings
```

### Step 17: Logging Configuration
```bash
# Check log directory
ls -la logs/

# Verify log file creation
tail -f logs/app.log

# Test log rotation (if configured)
```

### Step 18: Performance Testing
```bash
# Test with different drive sizes
# Monitor system resources during operations
# Verify timeout handling for long operations
```

## Phase 7: Build and Distribution

### Step 19: Build for Current Platform
```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

# Expected output:
# - dist/ folder with packaged application
# - Platform-specific installer
# - Application executable
```

### Step 20: Test Built Application
```bash
# Test the built application
# Navigate to dist/ folder
cd dist/

# Run the packaged application
# Verify all functionality works
```

### Step 21: Create Distribution Package
```bash
# Build for multiple platforms (if needed)
npm run build -- --win --linux --mac

# Create installer packages
# Test installation on target systems
```

## Phase 8: Deployment and Monitoring

### Step 22: Deploy to Target Systems
```bash
# Install on target systems
# Verify all dependencies are met
# Test on different hardware configurations
```

### Step 23: Set Up Monitoring
```bash
# Configure log monitoring
tail -f logs/app.log

# Set up system monitoring
# Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage during operations
```

### Step 24: Create Backup Procedures
```bash
# Backup configuration files
cp config.json config.json.backup

# Backup wipe scripts
cp wipe_linux.sh wipe_linux.sh.backup
cp wipe_windows.ps1 wipe_windows.ps1.backup

# Document recovery procedures
```

## Phase 9: Maintenance and Updates

### Step 25: Regular Maintenance Tasks
```bash
# Weekly: Check logs for errors
tail -n 100 logs/app.log | grep ERROR

# Monthly: Update dependencies
npm audit
npm update

# Quarterly: Security review
npm audit fix
```

### Step 26: Troubleshooting Procedures
```bash
# If application fails to start:
npm test  # Check backend functionality
npm run dev  # Try development mode

# If wipe operations fail:
# Check system logs
# Verify drive permissions
# Test with different drives
```

## Quick Reference Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Setup
./setup.sh                    # Automated setup
npm install                   # Install dependencies

# Testing
npm test                      # Backend tests
./wipe_linux.sh              # Test Linux script
powershell -File wipe_windows.ps1  # Test Windows script
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
